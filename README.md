# GameSave Hub

GameSave Hub is a desktop application for managing offline game save data in internet cafes, gaming centers, and diskless PC environments.

It is designed for shared gaming PCs where many players may use different client machines, and where local files can be reset after restart. The server stores user save data centrally, while the client helps players load and save their progress without manual file handling.

## Purpose

GameSave Hub makes game save handling easier, cleaner, and more consistent across multiple cafe PCs.

Each player can use their own account, choose a game, select a save slot, and keep their progress available even when moving to another PC.
